# starocie

A Kotlin Multiplatform app (Android + iOS) for two people who buy and sell
second-hand goods and want to know how profitable it is. Compose Multiplatform UI,
Firebase for storage and sync between two phones.

## The one principle everything else follows from

**Friction, not completeness.** A tracker that demands tidy bookkeeping gets
abandoned at the market stall. Partial records are first-class:

- item names are optional — the photo is the real identity
- costs may be unknown, and unknown must stay unknown rather than being guessed
- adding must never block on the network
- the buy and sell paths are a handful of taps each

When a change would make the app more correct but more demanding, it is the wrong
change. Prefer tolerating a messy record over requiring a tidy one.

Two known users, one shared pot. Profit is never attributed to or split between
them; `createdBy` is provenance for debugging and must not appear in any statistic
or filter.

## Domain model

Four entities, `Event → Buy → Item → Sell`, each arrow one-to-many.

```
Event(1) ──< Buy(n) ──< Item(n) ──< Sell(n)
   └──────────────────────────────< Sell(n)
```

**Foreign keys live on the "many" side, without exception**: `Buy.eventId`,
`Sell.eventId`, `Item.buyId`, `Sell.itemId`. There is deliberately no `sellId` on
`Item` — an item has many sells, so one id could not represent it.

A `Sell` points at both an item and an event, and they usually disagree: things are
sold at a different event from the one where they were bought.

| Entity | Fields |
|---|---|
| `Event` | `id`, `date`, `name?`, `note?` |
| `Buy` | `id`, `eventId`, `date`, `price?`, `name?`, `note?`, `photoUrls` |
| `Item` | `id`, `buyId?`, `date`, `name?`, `note?`, `photoUrls`, `price?`, `splittable`, `status` |
| `Sell` | `id`, `itemId`, `eventId`, `date`, `price`, `note?`, `soldCompletely` |

All four also carry `createdBy`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

`status` is `IN_STOCK | REMOVED | SOLD`. `REMOVED` covers broken, lost, given away
or kept — without it such an item never leaves stock and its buy never resolves.

### Invariants — break these and the numbers lie

1. **`Item.price` is the asking price, never what the item cost.** There is no cost
   field on `Item` at all. Cost lives on `Buy` and only on `Buy`. Label it "asking
   price" in the UI, because "price" on a thing instinctively reads as cost.
2. **Unknown cost stays unknown.** An item with no `buyId` was invented at point of
   sale; its cost and profit are `null`, never zero. Reporting such a sale as pure
   profit would inflate margins every time a shortcut is taken — exactly the
   behaviour this app exists to tolerate.
3. **Items are never hard-deleted.** `REMOVED` is the exit. Every `Sell.itemId`
   must stay resolvable.
4. **Nothing derivable is stored** — no thumbnails, no denormalised names, no
   device paths, no cached statistics.
5. **Three kinds of "when", each with exactly one job:**
   - `createdAt` — audit stamp. Set once, never edited, never used for reporting.
   - `date` — defaulted from `createdAt`, freely editable, drives sorting/filters.
   - `eventId` — the *sole* authority for grouping.

   Never group by `date`. If one screen groups by `date` and another by `eventId`,
   an edited date silently yields two answers to the same question.

## Money

```kotlin
@JvmInline value class Money(val minor: Long)   // grosz
```

Every monetary field is `Money` — never `Long`, never a float. This is why fields
are named plainly (`price`, not `priceMinor`): the type enforces the unit at
compile time. A custom `KSerializer` stores it as a plain integer. Single currency
(PLN). Formatting happens only at the UI edge.

`@JvmInline` lives in `kotlin.jvm` but is usable from `commonMain` — required on
JVM/Android, a no-op on Kotlin/Native. Value classes are mangled crossing into
Swift, which does not matter here: iOS only receives a Compose `UIViewController`.

## Cost allocation

- **no buy** → cost unknown, profit `null`
- **sole item of its buy** → cost is the buy price, exact
- **one of many** → the buy price is split across items in proportion to
  `Item.price`, and flagged estimated

`Item.price` is optional, so the split degrades:

1. all items priced → proportional
2. some priced → unpriced items take the mean of the priced ones, then proportional
3. none priced → even split

**Rounding is largest-remainder**: floor each share, then hand out leftover grosz
one at a time, largest fractional remainder first. Shares must sum to *exactly* the
buy price, so a buy's profit always equals the sum of its items' profits. Naive
rounding drops a grosz and the two figures silently disagree.

Removed items still take an allocation — their share is a loss, not a gap.

Every estimated figure must be visibly marked. An exact cost and a guess must never
look alike.

## Statistics — computed, never stored

Pure functions over the in-memory collections, exposed as nested `stats` objects.
Nothing is written to Firestore, so nothing can drift. Unit-testable without
Firebase and identical on every platform.

- `Item.stats` — `sellCount`, `proceeds`, `cost?`, `costIsEstimated`, `profit?`,
  `profitIsEstimated`, `soldAt?`
- `Buy.stats` — `itemCount`, `resolvedItemCount`, `cost`, `proceeds`, `profit?`,
  `fullyResolved`
- `Event.stats` — `spent`, `earned`, `buyCount`, `sellCount`, `itemsBought`,
  `itemsSold`

Buy-level profit is never an estimate — measured cost against measured proceeds.
Only the split beneath it is inferred.

`Event.stats` is cash in and cash out, **not** profit: what you sell at an event is
rarely what you bought there. Never subtract one from the other.

Profit is sale prices minus buying prices. No fees, no shipping, no overhead.

## Firestore

**Four flat sibling collections — not nested subcollections.**

```
workspaces/{wsId}                      members: [uid, uid]
workspaces/{wsId}/events/{eventId}     id = ISO date when auto-created
workspaces/{wsId}/buys/{buyId}
workspaces/{wsId}/items/{itemId}
workspaces/{wsId}/sells/{sellId}
```

The hierarchy lives purely in the reference fields. Nesting is impossible because
`Sell` has two parents; it would also turn "all `IN_STOCK` items" (the Sell grid,
the most important query in the app) into a `collectionGroup` query, and turn
reassigning a buy to another event into a document move.

Security rules are a single predicate: the caller's uid is in the workspace's
`members` array. No per-collection variations.

- **Firestore, not Realtime Database**, for its offline persistence: markets have
  bad signal, and it gives durable local writes and automatic sync for free.
- **No SQLDelight** — Firestore's cache *is* the local database.
- All collections are held in memory. That is what makes computed statistics, name
  joins and instant offline search viable. Revisit only at orders-of-magnitude
  growth.
- **Multi-document writes use `WriteBatch`, never a transaction.** Transactions
  need a server round-trip and fail offline, breaking the stall case exactly when
  it matters.
- **Writes never block on the network.** Firestore's local cache echoes the write
  immediately and the UI reflects that optimistic state. Never show a spinner while
  saving.

### Events are automatic but real

Recording a buy or sell resolves the current event: find today's, create it if
absent, attach. The user is never asked.

**The auto-created event's document id is the ISO date** (`2026-08-01`). This is
load-bearing: at a market both phones are likely offline, and with random ids each
device would invent its own "today" and produce duplicate events for one day. A
deterministic id means both write the same document and converge on reconnect. Use
`SetOptions.merge`. Extra events on a day are user-created and get UUIDs.

## Photos

Documents carry `photoUrls` only. **A filesystem path must never sync** — it is
meaningless on the other person's phone.

- capture, compress to ~1200px JPEG, write to `filesDir/photos/{itemId}/{n}.jpg`
- display checks that conventional path first, falls back to the remote URL, so a
  photo appears instantly, before any upload
- a device-local `PendingUploadStore` (never synced) tracks what needs uploading
- a background worker drains it and appends to `photoUrls`
- no stored thumbnails; Coil downsamples
- never upload a raw camera file

## Architecture

Single `composeApp` module — `commonMain` / `androidMain` / `iosMain`, packaged by
layer. Splitting into several Gradle modules at this size costs more than it
returns. Android and iOS only; no desktop target.

- Compose Multiplatform UI, `androidx.lifecycle` ViewModel (KMP)
- `androidx.navigation` multiplatform
- Koin for DI
- GitLive `dev.gitlive:firebase-kotlin-sdk` — firestore, auth, storage
- Coil 3 for images
- kotlinx: coroutines, datetime, serialization
- Repositories expose Firestore snapshot listeners as `Flow`; ViewModels combine
  the streams and compute `stats`; Compose collects `StateFlow`
- `CurrentEventResolver` — the single place the auto-grouping rule lives
- `ItemNameSuggester` — interface with a no-op default; photo-to-name recognition
  is a later feature and must drop in without reshaping the model

### Conventions

- **No `java.*` in `commonMain`.** kotlinx-datetime for time, `kotlin.uuid.Uuid`
  for ids. Keep the iOS target compiling at all times, even during Android-only
  work — the compiler is what enforces this.
- **Screens never touch Firestore directly.** All access goes through a repository;
  screens observe `Flow`s and call suspend functions on a state holder.
- Domain models are immutable data classes.
- Observing functions return `Flow<T>`; one-shot operations are `suspend`.
- Ids are generated client-side, so a record exists locally the instant it is made.
- Prefer `sealed interface` over strings and booleans for status and result types.

## Screens

- **Home** — big BUY and SELL buttons over recent activity; the current event's
  name sits at the top, tappable to name it.
- **Buy** — one flow; buying and unpacking happen in one sitting. Total paid first
  (the number you always know), then photograph the contents. Each photo becomes an
  item. One photo → sole item, exact cost. Several → box total, allocated. Never
  asks for a per-item cost.
- **Sell** — search field above a visual grid of `IN_STOCK` items. The grid is what
  makes nameless items sellable: you recognise the photo. Tap, enter final price,
  done. "Add new" creates an item with no buy. Splittables show a note field and a
  "fully sold" tick setting `soldCompletely`. Long-press offers "remove".

## Setup

Neither secrets file is committed — each machine needs its own:

- `androidApp/google-services.json` (Android)
- `iosApp/GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)

Both are gitignored. A second developer needs copies from the Firebase console.

The `com.google.gms.google-services` plugin is applied only when the JSON is
present, so a fresh clone still builds and runs — Firebase is inert until the
config arrives, rather than the build failing on a missing secret.
